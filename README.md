# Agentic AI in Remote Sensing
This repository curates and categorizes Agentic AI methods for Remote Sensing, following the taxonomy and references introduced in our survey paper: [*Agentic AI in Remote Sensing: Foundations, Taxonomy, and Emerging Systems*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01891). Considering the rapid growth of this field, we will continue to update this repo.
